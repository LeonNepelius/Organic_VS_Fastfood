                    <li>... Safe from Dangerous Pesticides:
                      Chemical pesticides has been linked to breast, prostrate and other cancers, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, leukemia, infertility, convulsions, immune and endocrine disorders, Parkinson's disease and depression. Just to name a few!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... Stronger, More Energetic Body:
                      No pesticides, chemicals, or processed additives bogging down your system means a smaller risk of disease, illness, and disorders in yourself. Nothing leaves you feeling tired and gross like unhealthy junk food.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... It Tastes Better:
                      True, it may not taste as good if you're accustomed to the addictive qualities of junk food additives, such as processed sugar and MSG. But after just a short time of your body experiencing truly healthy food, you'll be craving it. No, really, you will. And all the crap will start having a bad after-taste.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... Peace of Mind:
                      Knowing your buying organic food can help you to enjoy what you eat for all the reasons outlined above and below.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... Safe from Scary Chemicals:
                      Herbicides and fertilizers have been connected with various cancers, immune disorders, infertility, cardiac disease, hypertension, and numerous other diseases.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>... Cost:
                      For the end consumer, cost is one of the biggest disadvantages of organic foods. Organic farming is more time and labor intensive, and the organic certification process can be costly and difficult.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... Productivity
                      Organic farming allows for less productivity per acre of land farmed than conventional industrial farming methods. The increased popularity of organic foods may lead to more large organic farms, with a higher use of fossil fuels and other resources, reports Pennybacker. Increased demand is leading to new sources for organic foods, including China.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... Time and Skill
                      Farming organically requires more time on the part of the farmer. Soil must be cultivated, crops tended and weeds managed. It is more labor intensive than conventional farming, and the farmer may not be able to tend as much land as he could with industrialized farming approaches.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... Spoilage
                      Organics are not treated with preservatives, waxes or other chemicals. This may reduce their shelf life and allow for faster spoilage. This can be a problem for both consumers and stores, especially if the foods have to be transported a significant distance, reports the Mayo Clinic.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>... Location
                      Some people opt for locally grown and produced foods as much as possible. You may find these foods in your local stores or at farmers' markets and roadside stands. In many cases, they are not certified organic. Locally grown foods are fresher and require the use of fewer resources for transportation.</li>

                <h3>5 <font color="green">Positive</font> Aspects about fastfood</h3>

                <ol>
                  <li>... It's fast:<br>
                    Fast food lives up to its name: in ten minutes you have a reasonably warm meal in the paper bag, which lasts at least two hours. Instead of spending hours in the kitchen or waiting in the restaurant for unfriendly waiters, the food at McDonalds is at best eaten in 20 minutes.</li>
                    <br>
                  <li>... It is everywhere:<br>
                    At the train station, on the motorway or while shopping - almost everywhere there is a branch of fast-food giants. So you get tired of passing through quickly.</li>
                    <br>
                  <li>... No surprises:<br>
                    When malaise is detected in a fast-food giant, it hails negative news headlines, see recent reports on some Burger King stores. The corporations know this - and therefore set controlled supply chains, standardized production processes and hygiene regulations. If they are respected. Allergy sufferers also appreciate the fact that the products are always made with the same ingredients.</li>
                    <br>
                  <li>... Children love it:<br>
                    All teachers and parents in Prenzlauer Berg please stop listening. Kids love McDonald's - and sometimes it's okay to buy a Happy Meal for the whining little ones while strolling through town, complete with a game character (which reliably breaks down after a few weeks). It does not have to be the children's birthday party with Ronald McDonald.</li>
                    <br>
                  <li>... It tastes good:<br>
            Of course, everyone knows that a burger is not healthy. But let's be honest: such a greasy menu with fries and Big Mac tastes easy. For years, the companies have completely adapted their recipes to the mass taste. Just after a few beers they taste like nocturnal snakes show at the counters.</li>

                <h3>5 <font color="red">Negative</font> Aspects about fastfood</h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>... is too greasy:<br>
                    fat is a flavor carrier that the fast-food industry uses generously in food. Frying or frying in oil also makes the food even calorie-rich and unhealthy. Fast food contains many fats that are hazardous to health, including artificial trans fatty acids, which are produced during the industrial hardening of oil and excessive heat. And these fats - so the result of many studies - not only make you fat, but also sick.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>... makes you sick:<br>
                    The trans fatty acids contained in fast food increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. In addition, they drive up the bad so-called LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), which is one of the main risk factors for arteriosclerosis (vascular calcification). The additives usually found in fast food can also cause allergies.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>... thickens:<br>
                    Numerous studies prove a connection between the consumption of fast food and obesity. In addition, the fast meals hardly provide valuable nutrients, it lacks vitamins, minerals and fiber.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>... is eaten way too fast:<br>
                    French fries, burgers and co are usually consumed too hectically - often "on the go" when walking or standing. For digestion but the enrichment of eating with saliva is important, which is achieved only by frequent chewing. In addition, when you eat fast food, the feeling of fullness starts late, which in turn causes us to overeat.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>... does not last long:<br>
                    Usually, complex carbohydrates and fiber (especially in whole grains) provide a long-lasting satiety. However, these are hardly included in fast-food products, and so you are soon hungry after eating burgers, chips and Co.</li>
