    <h3>5 <font color="green">Positive</font> Aspects about fastfood</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>... It's fast
        Fast food lives up to its name: in ten minutes you have a reasonably warm meal in the paper bag, which lasts at least two hours. Instead of spending hours in the kitchen or waiting in the restaurant for unfriendly waiters, the food at McDonalds is at best eaten in 20 minutes.</li>
        <br>
      <li>... It is everywhere
        At the train station, on the motorway or while shopping - almost everywhere there is a branch of fast-food giants. So you get tired of passing through quickly.</li>
        <br>
      <li>... No surprises
        When malaise is detected in a fast-food giant, it hails negative news headlines, see recent reports on some Burger King stores. The corporations know this - and therefore set controlled supply chains, standardized production processes and hygiene regulations. If they are respected. Allergy sufferers also appreciate the fact that the products are always made with the same ingredients.</li>
        <br>
      <li>... Children love it
        All teachers and parents in Prenzlauer Berg please stop listening. Kids love McDonald's - and sometimes it's okay to buy a Happy Meal for the whining little ones while strolling through town, complete with a game character (which reliably breaks down after a few weeks). It does not have to be the children's birthday party with Ronald McDonald.</li>
        <br>
      <li>... It tastes good
Of course, everyone knows that a burger is not healthy. But let's be honest: such a greasy menu with fries and Big Mac tastes easy. For years, the companies have completely adapted their recipes to the mass taste. Just after a few beers they taste like nocturnal snakes show at the counters.</li>

    </ol>
    <br>
    <h3>5 <font color="red">Negative</font> Aspects about fastfood</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>... is too greasy: fat is a flavor carrier that the fast-food industry uses generously in food. Frying or frying in oil also makes the food even calorie-rich and unhealthy. Fast food contains many fats that are hazardous to health, including artificial trans fatty acids, which are produced during the industrial hardening of oil and excessive heat. And these fats - so the result of many studies - not only make you fat, but also sick.</li>
      <br>
      <li>... makes you sick: The trans fatty acids contained in fast food increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. In addition, they drive up the bad so-called LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), which is one of the main risk factors for arteriosclerosis (vascular calcification). The additives usually found in fast food can also cause allergies.</li>
      <br>
      <li>... thickens: Numerous studies prove a connection between the consumption of fast food and obesity. In addition, the fast meals hardly provide valuable nutrients, it lacks vitamins, minerals and fiber.</li>
      <br>
      <li>... is eaten way too fast: French fries, burgers and co are usually consumed too hectically - often "on the go" when walking or standing. For digestion but the enrichment of eating with saliva is important, which is achieved only by frequent chewing. In addition, when you eat fast food, the feeling of fullness starts late, which in turn causes us to overeat.</li>
      <br>
      <li>... does not last long: Usually, complex carbohydrates and fiber (especially in whole grains) provide a long-lasting satiety. However, these are hardly included in fast-food products, and so you are soon hungry after eating burgers, chips and Co.</li>
      <br>
